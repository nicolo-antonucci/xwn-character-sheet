Every High Mage is well-educated in the principles of magic as understood by the sorcerers of Latter Earth.\nHigh Mages can prepare and cast High Magic spells, and have a number of arts dedicated to improving their use of these incantations. As usual for spellcasters, they cannot wear bulky clothing or armor while casting or using arts, nor use shields. Mages who have trained to overcome these limits with the Armored Magic Focus have more latitude.\nHigh Mages conduct extensive experimentation and study as part of their daily activities. This relentless focus helps them master High Magic spells without needing the outside help of tutors and discovered texts. Each time they advance a level, they may pick two High Magic spells from the list in this book to add to their repertoire. These spells must be of a level they can cast.\nHigh Mages also gain arts specific to their tradition. At first level, a full High Mage picks two arts and a partial picks one. As they gain levels and experience, they’ll learn additional arts from the adjacent list. Once picked, an art cannot be changed.",

Thus, a Partial Warrior/Partial Healer might be a grizzled combat medic, a Partial Expert/Partial Healer might be an erudite physician gifted in both mundane and magical healing methods, and a Partial Necromancer/ Partial Healer might be an adept of life and death.\nAll Healers gain Heal as a bonus skill, acquiring it at level-0, or level-1 if they already have it at level-0. A basic grounding in mundane healing techniques is necessary in order to learn their more sophisticated magical arts.\nHealers do not learn how to cast spells. Instead, they focus on their special arcane healing arts. Wielding these arts usually requires nothing more than touching the target and concentrating on the desired effect, and the process is direct and simple enough to perform even when burdened by armor or carrying a shield. These arts are usually quite subtle, and don’t produce visible or audible indications of their use.\nA Healer may have certain social advantages in some situations, depending on the culture and their own traditions. Even in the roughest surroundings, a proven Healer can likely expect hospitality and decent treatment in exchange for their efforts in treating the innumerable pains and augues of their hosts. A famous Healer can often impose on the powerful in exchange for curing some noble’s persistent or difficult case of illness.\nAt first level, a Healer gains the Healing Touch art and can pick one more of their choice. As they advance in levels afterwards, they can learn new arts. Once chosen, an art is permanent and cannot be exchanged.",
